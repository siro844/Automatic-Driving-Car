# Project Name: PPO-CNN Car Racing Agent

## Overview:
This project focuses on training an agent to navigate the Box2D Car Racing environment using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) policy. The goal is to demonstrate significant improvement in the agent's performance, measured by the reward it achieves in the environment.

## Key Achievements:
- **Algorithm Used:** Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) policy.
- **Training Steps:** The agent was trained over 1.1 million steps to learn effective policies for optimal performance in the Box2D Car Racing environment.
- **Performance Improvement:** The reward increased from an initial value of around -400 before training to a significantly improved range of 870 to 900 after training.

## Results:
After training for 1.1 million steps, the agent demonstrates a remarkable improvement in its ability to navigate the Box2D Car Racing environment. The reward, which was initially around -400, has now increased to a range of 870 to 900.

## Future Work:
- Fine-tune hyperparameters to potentially achieve even higher rewards.
- Explore different neural network architectures to enhance the agent's learning capabilities.
- Generalize the trained agent's policies to perform well in similar but unseen environments.
